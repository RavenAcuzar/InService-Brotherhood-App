                                                individuals. They facilitate preparations needed before and after each
                                                event. They are comprised of Independent Representatives (IR) who were
                                                chosen to provide tireless service to their fellow IRs and are
                                                instrumental to the success of every V event. This is the InService
                                                Brotherhood.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>The InService Brotherhood had its humble beginnings in 1999, which saw the V
                                                starting with small events such as business presentations, in which the
                                                V Partners themselves acted as crew members.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>In a couple of years, V events grew in frequency and size. In 2001, the very
                                                first V-Convention was held in Bali, Indonesia, and for the first time
                                                in the V event history, a group of leaders was formed to provide service
                                                for the event. Even with a lack of a formal training, these selected
                                                individuals performed quite an exemplary task. After all, there is no
                                                one better to serve but members of The V family themselves who are keen
                                                on being of assistance to their fellow V brothers and sisters.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Over the years, the V-Convention has established itself as the flagship event
                                                of The V&mdash;making its way across the globe to numerous countries
                                                such as Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. From mere hundreds,
                                                the attendees of the V-Convention grew to thousands, which has
                                                established the event as a grand spectacle anticipated by all members of
                                                the V community.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>With each V-Convention surpassing the last, the need for more InService
                                                members became more evident. In March 2007, the InService
                                                Brotherhood was officially formed during the very first InService
                                                Brotherhood Bootcamp held in Camp John Hay in Baguio City, Philippines.

                                        <p>Independent Representatives were chosen to take part in the special training

                                        <p>Since 2007, the Core InService has guided the IR volunteers. V Partner

                                                leaders. The Core InService exudes true servant leadership and
                                                selflessness. This group of people, along with the other members of the

                                                excitement, it didn&rsquo;t take long before it was molded and
                                                recognised as a yearly V tradition. It has become a must-attend event

                                                privilege, as it provided the best avenue not only for personal growth

                                                serve. We serve to lead.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Dato Sri Vijay Eswaran asserts that &ldquo;InService is a beautiful concept
                                                because we share the wisdom of leading through service.&rdquo; For every
                                                leader who volunteers as InService, there is thus a clear acceptance,
                                                understanding, and commitment to placing service above self.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>One must not expect accolades and recognition while in service. It is a
                                                humbling experience, and not a stage for acknowledgment. To be in
                                                service is an honor and a privilege. We must raise ourselves higher so
                                                that we can serve better. The more prepared and open we are to service,
                                                the better we can uplift those whom we serve.&nbsp; Service is our
                                                greatest asset, greatest weapon, and most of all, it is our purpose of
                                                who we are. In the words of Dato Sri Vijay, &ldquo;If you are born to
                                                lead, you must be born to serve.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>It is in service that we give. It is in service that we live. Let this be
                                                your vocation.</p>

                                        <p>To be blessed with a life of comfort and financial freedom is not something
                                                that should be taken for granted. Most members of the InService
                                                Brotherhood have been vastly rewarded due to their hard work and

                                        <p>&ldquo;You can never pay back; but you can always pay forward&rdquo; &ndash;

                                        <p>Financial freedom is considered the ultimate reward in the network marketing
                                                business, and all Independent Representatives aspire for this. However,
                                                the teachings of the InService Brotherhood remind its members that
                                                one&rsquo;s goal must not end with amassing worldly riches, that these
                                                material possessions must be utilised to create a better world for all
                                                of.</p>

                                                        whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive
                                                        must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for

                                        <p>Living by this motto will raise many questions in every individual, and at
                                                first, one&rsquo;s reasons for paying it forward may seem selfish. The
                                                ego is a strong and powerful force, and one may at first feel compelled
                                                to pay it forward in order to gain more. Reciprocity is the first
                                                instinct of any individual, but with continuous practice of paying it
                                                forward, one will come to realize that the desire to pay it forward for
                                                one&rsquo;s personal goals will diminish, and learn of the inherent
                                                satisfaction that comes with being able to help others.</p>

                                        <p>Living a life of service gradually becomes part of one&rsquo;s nature. Each
                                                person has to be of service to another &ndash; both as a responsibility
                                                and a privilege. Being able to help another is not something that comes
